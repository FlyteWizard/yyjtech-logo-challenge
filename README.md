# YYJ Tech Logo Challenge

F.A.Q. about the logo challenge can be found here. 


## About

YYJ Tech is a community of professionals, hackers, designers, students and anyone interested in technology in Victoria, British Columbia (Canada). Please read the Code of [Conduct](https://github.com/yyjtech/code-of-conduct) and feel free to join the [Slack Channel](https://joinyyjtechslack.herokuapp.com/).


## Why?

The previous logo (despite it being cute) wasn't ours ðŸ˜¢. We decided to hold a challenge for our new YYJ Tech Logo. 

## Guidelines

#### From Slack 

> Your team icon is a way for you to visually identify the team. It is used in the desktop and mobile apps, and on your team site. Itâ€™s most helpful when youâ€™re on multiple Slack teams.

```
Some tips on choosing a good icon:

- Use a solid background color.
- Use a graphical logo or image rather than text.
- Leave some space around your icon.
- Upload an image that is 132px square or larger.
```

#### From YYJ Tech

```
- Must be original.
- Whales?
- Represent YYJ Tech Community.
```
